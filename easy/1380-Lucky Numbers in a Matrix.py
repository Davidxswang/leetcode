Given a m * n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

 

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 50
1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5.
All elements in the matrix are distinct.
"""

# This is inspired by @C0R3 in the discussion area. Because every element is distinct, so we can use set intersection to find the lucky numbers.
# time complexity: O(mn), space complexity: O(mn)

class Solution:
    def luckyNumbers (self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        return list(set(min(row) for row in matrix) & set(max(column) for column in zip(*matrix)))
