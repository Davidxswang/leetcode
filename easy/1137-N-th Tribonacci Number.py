https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/
The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.



Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Example 2:

Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537


Constraints:

0 <= n <= 37
The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. answer <= 2^31 - 1.
