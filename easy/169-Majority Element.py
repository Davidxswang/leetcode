https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

# Pretty easy.

    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

# Another solution is inspired by the discussion area: Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm.
# A demo is here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/best-ideas/mjrty/
# The main idea is that if the majority element exist than, the total number of majority numbers should be at least 1 larger than the sum of the number of other elements.
# So when we start traverse, we mark an element and a counter, start with the first element nums[0] and counter = 1.
#   If the counter is 0, we start the counter from 0 in the current element. (Because counter == 0 means that the number of this element is the same as the number of other elements before the number we are looking right now)
#   If we see the same number, counter ++
#   If we see a different number counter --
# time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(1)
