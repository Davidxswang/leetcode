https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]

# time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(1)
# this is provided by @orbuluh in the discussion area. 
# The idea here is very similar to the problem "Major Element". The core is to traverse twice.
# the first traversal is to find two candidates. Ideally, two candidates should be the remaining elements after being cancelling out by the non-candidate elements.

    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
